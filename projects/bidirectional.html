    <h2>Bidirectional Human-Robot System with Touch (2025)</h2>
    <p>
      This project explores the design of haptic feedback systems to enable more intuitive 
      teleoperation and communication between humans and robots. The goal was to 
      create a two-way interface that allows operators not only to control robotic 
      systems but also to “feel” the environment through tactile signals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The system was tested on robotic platforms and integrated with tactile sensors 
      developed as part of my doctoral research at UCLA.
