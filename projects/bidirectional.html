    <h2>Bidirectional Human-Robot System with Touch</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this project was to create a two-way interface that allows operators to not only control robotic systems, but also to sense and interpret touch-based feedback from the environment through a haptic display.<br>
      This work was carried out in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the University of Washington (UW), and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), with funding from the Office of Naval Research (ONR).<br>
      Details will be added once the research is published.
